# Befeni Technical Tests

### If you have been instructed to check out this repository we are hoping to work with you and want to assess your skills in order to proceed with an interview.

In order to do this we have created two tests.

----

The [Basic Test](basic-test/readme.md) allows us to check that you have entry level programming ability and that you can use your programming language of choice to successfully solve a set of requirements. The scope of the test is intentionally kept simple so that exceptional candidates can show us their full reportoire of skills.

(all developers must take this test, you can implement the solution in the language of your choice!)

----

The [Advanced Backend Test](advanced-backend-test/readme.md) will ask you to reimplement functionality found in common frameworks and is designed to show us whether you understand design patterns and can build well architected solutions. We don't expect you to go overboard with this one - just show us that you have the understanding and skill-set we expect from a senior developers.

(only backend developers should take this test!)

----

The [Advanced Frontend Test](advanced-frontend-test/readme.md) will ask you to use our API end points to design a very simple Javascript application so you can demonstrate that you have the ability to build single page applications in the framework of your choice. Whilst we're not expecting an expansive application, this test will give you the opportunity to show us your ability to work with modern JS language features (and hopefully Typescript) and tooling like webpack, SaSS and so on.

(only frontend developers should take this test!)

----

Please clone this repository, create your solutions within the two directories and then push to your own private account. Reply to the email sent from hr@befeni.com inviting you to complete these tests when you have finished.
